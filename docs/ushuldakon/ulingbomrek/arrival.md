## Excerpt from Sazir's Record of the Settling of Iklistbomrek

125-01-15

We arrived at Iklistbomrek in the early hours. Id was quick to feel important. The dwarf who kept to himself the entire way here is now ready for our undying allegiance and devotion. I want to record these events to show how it really should have been me in charge, I am more important after all.

We stopped the wagons where the forest began to get denser and go uphill. We're a jog west of the spring that made this area possible for habitation. The original plan was to get Iklistbomrek founded here on the eastern edge of The Null Mountain range to better establish The Lustrous Lens.

Id has decided that the surface section of Iklistbomrek should be along the brook, with a water inlet on the north side of the walls. Ha this will be our downfall.

<p>Just as we finished furnishing our bedrooms, a group of migrants arrives at our fortress. I guess it was just in time. We plan out some more bedrooms a layer above and request more beds built.</p>
<p>We also make progress on the above-ground section of the fortress, with our two mason workshops creating jet blocks nonstop. It's 90% walled in at this point.</p>

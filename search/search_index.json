We would build a large walled-in section above ground to provide grazing space for our livestock and to let us safely take advantage of the fruit trees in the area. We dig down into the sandy top layers of earth and station our dogs at the entrance. A few layers down, we dig out an area for farming and brewing. Our farmer suggested having a few small plots each for a specific crop, so for each underground crop has its own plot. Also on this layer we dug out space to harvest sand and installed a kitchen. We continue downwards until we are solidly in the stone layers. The pitch black jet catches our eyes and we decided to cut blocks out of jet to use for our walls above ground. We quickly dig out a large enough area to store our supplies and then set to digging out as much jet from the walls as possible. We plan out space for bedrooms, poultry coops and a temple. The first logs we chop down from the surface get used to make beds, tables, and chairs for a make-shift barracks and dining room. With our miners busy carving out the fortress, the rest of us haul our supplies underground. Although it's mostly quiet in our immediate area, we have had some run-ins with honey badgers and one even ran off with some plump helmet spawn.
